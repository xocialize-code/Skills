# Common PyTorch → MLX Port Pitfalls

Six recurring traps that have broken past ports. Each comes with a concrete failure mode — read these *before* writing MLX code, not after debugging wrong output.

## 1. Constructor defaults silently diverging from model config

**What goes wrong:** A PyTorch module's `__init__` has a default that differs from the checkpoint's `config.json`. If the config doesn't store that parameter explicitly, the MLX port inherits the *default* instead of the trained value.

**Past failure (Hunyuan3D VAE, FourierEmbedder):** Default was `include_pi=True`, config specified `include_pi=False`. Not stored in config.json, so the default propagated silently into MLX. Frequencies got multiplied by π → garbage SDF values → mesh rendered as grid noise. Correlation with PyTorch output: 0.09.

**Rule:** Cross-check **every** constructor default against the source model's training config. Pay special attention to boolean flags that affect numerical computation: `include_pi`, `use_bias`, `qk_norm`, `flip_sin_to_cos`, `downscale_freq_shift`, `pre_norm`. If a parameter isn't in `config.json`, set the MLX default to match the training config value, not the framework default.

**Idiomatic solution (Tier 2 manual port):** Every config flag becomes a field on `@dataclass ModelArgs(BaseModelArgs)` with the **trained** default — never the framework default. The `ModelArgs` block in `mlx_lm/models/qwen2.py` is the reference shape. The official converter trusts `ModelArgs` defaults; mismatch there silently propagates into every load.

## 2. `attention_head_dim` is secretly `num_heads`

**What goes wrong:** In `diffusers.UNet2DConditionModel`, config field `attention_head_dim` is misnamed — it is actually `num_attention_heads`. The real per-head dimension is `channels // attention_head_dim`.

**Past failure (Hunyuan3D-2.1 paint UNet, SD 2.1):** Config `attention_head_dim=[5, 10, 20, 20]` with `block_out_channels=[320, 640, 1280, 1280]`. Correct interpretation:
- Block 0: **5 heads of dim 64** (not 64 heads of dim 5)
- Block 1: 10 heads of dim 64
- Block 2–3: 20 heads of dim 64

Weights (Linear 320→320) have identical shape either way, so the bug loads silently. But the reshape `(B, L, heads, dim)` puts different dims in different axes, changing the softmax pattern completely. Error per UNet pass: 0.21 × 15 denoising steps → cyan / neutral textures. Fixing to `num_heads = attention_head_dim[i]` brought parity to 1e-5.

**Rule:** For diffusers UNets: `num_heads = config.attention_head_dim[i]` directly — **don't divide**. Let `head_dim = channels // num_heads`. Verify by comparing `model.attn1.heads` to the raw config value. If building both `diffusers.UNet2DConditionModel.from_config(cfg)` and the MLX port side-by-side, the PyTorch `tb.attn1.heads` is authoritative.

**Idiomatic solution (Tier 2):** When porting a diffusers-style vision tower into `mlx_vlm/models/<name>/vision.py`, mirror `num_attention_heads` into your `VisionConfig` dataclass directly. Do **not** compute it from `attention_head_dim`. `mlx_vlm/models/qwen2_vl/vision.py` shows the safe pattern (named fields, no clever derivations).

## 3. Interleaved QKV vs independent reshape

**What goes wrong:** Some attention implementations concatenate Q, K, V *before* reshaping into multi-head format. The result is that heads are interleaved across the Q/K/V dimension. Standard per-tensor reshape produces totally wrong attention.

**Past failure (Hunyuan3D DiT attention):** Source did `qkv = cat([q, k, v], -1); qkv = qkv.view(B, N, heads, 3*hd); q, k, v = qkv.chunk(3, -1)`. Porting naively with separate reshapes (`q.view(B,N,heads,hd)`) produces max-diff 2.5 vs 6.7e-4 with correct interleaving. Model is trained with this interleaving so there is no choice.

**Rule:** Before writing attention, read the EXACT PyTorch reshape / view / split sequence. Any `cat(...) → view(... , 3*hd) → split` is an interleaved pattern and must be replicated as-is. Don't assume the "natural" per-tensor reshape.

**Idiomatic solution (Tier 2):** Handle the interleave inside `sanitize(weights)` — split the fused upstream tensor into separately interleaved Q/K/V and re-stack so runtime code stays naive. Then `mlx_lm.models.base.scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, ...)` works on properly shaped tensors regardless of upstream's fused layout. The converter calls `Model.sanitize` automatically, so weight-side normalization is the right place.

See `attention-patterns.md` for the translated MLX code for both patterns.

## 4. Weight layout differences

**What goes wrong:** Conv weights have different memory layout across frameworks.

- PyTorch Conv2d: `(O, I, H, W)` — channels-first, out-first.
- MLX Conv2d: `(O, H, W, I)` — channels-last, out-first.
- PyTorch ConvTranspose2d: `(I, O, H, W)` — in-first.
- MLX ConvTranspose2d: `(O, H, W, I)` — same layout as Conv2d but with swapped channel semantics during op.
- Linear: `(O, I)` identical in both.
- Embedding: `(vocab, dim)` identical in both.

If the conversion recipe forgets to transpose, the weights load without errors but the convolution computes nonsense.

**Rule:** Use `mlx_forge.transpose.transpose_conv(key, weight, kind)` in the recipe — it handles all the conv variants generically. For hand-rolled conversion: when you see a key containing `.conv.weight` or ending in a spatial pattern, transpose.

**Idiomatic solution (Tier 2):** Transpose inside `sanitize(weights)`. Vision sub-packages (`mlx_vlm/models/*/vision.py`) need this constantly — look at the existing ports for the canonical `weight.transpose(0, 2, 3, 1)` pattern on Conv2d, and the equivalent for Conv1d / Conv3d / ConvTranspose2d. Putting the transpose at forward time instead leaks PyTorch layout into MLX runtime and shows up as a `Conv2d` shape mismatch on the first call.

## 5. Normalization semantic drift

**What goes wrong:** Different frameworks have different defaults and subtle behavior differences for normalization layers.

- **Default epsilon:** PyTorch `LayerNorm` is 1e-5, MLX `mlx.nn.LayerNorm` is 1e-5 — match. But diffusers `GroupNorm` often uses 1e-6, and some transformers set 1e-12. Always read the source.
- **RMSNorm weight semantics:** some implementations fuse gain into sqrt (`x / sqrt(var + eps) * (1 + gain)`), some don't (`* gain`). Check the reference.
- **AdaLN variants:** additive-only `x + shift` is NOT the same as classic `x * (1 + scale) + shift`. Hunyuan3D uses additive-only; LTX uses classic with 9 packed params; Matrix-Game has a `condition_type="token_replace"` branch.
- **GroupNorm num_groups:** if the reference uses `num_groups=32` unconditionally, don't compute it from channels — match exactly.

**Rule:** For every norm layer: read the exact PyTorch forward pass. Don't assume MLX defaults match.

**Idiomatic solution (Tier 2):** Prefer `mx.fast.rms_norm` / `mx.fast.layer_norm` on the hot path (faster and numerically stabler than hand-rolled). For GroupNorm with non-default eps, AdaLN variants, or any fused-norm flag, parameterize on `ModelArgs` and mirror upstream's exact `__call__` body. **`groupnorm_eps` is the most common silent killer for VAE ports** — see pitfall #10.

## 6. Non-obvious flags and activation choices

**What goes wrong:** A small config flag flips a computation subtly and silently.

Common culprits:
- `qk_norm` — if true, Q and K are normalized before the dot product. Skipping this changes attention scale significantly.
- `use_bias` on Linear / Conv / QKV projections — differs across block types within the same model.
- `cross_attention_dim` — when cross-attn is present but dim differs from self-attn, projection shapes differ.
- Activation: GEGLU (`gate * gelu(up)`), SwiGLU (`gate * silu(up)`), GELU (no gate), ReLU². Each has a different parameter count and math.
- `sandwich_norm`, `pre_norm` vs `post_norm` — position of norm relative to attention / FFN changes residual math.
- `flip_sin_to_cos`, `downscale_freq_shift` in timestep embedding — affects which half of the sinusoidal encoding goes where.

**Rule:** Before translating a block, list every flag the PyTorch class checks and write a mini-table mapping config value → code branch. Then translate each branch.

**Idiomatic solution (Tier 2):** Each flag → field on `@dataclass ModelArgs` with the **trained** config default. `mlx_lm/models/qwen2.py` is the reference shape — every architectural toggle (`qk_norm`, `tie_word_embeddings`, `rope_traditional`, `rope_scaling`) has a default that matches the upstream `config.json`. The dataclass becomes the single source of truth; runtime code reads `self.args.<flag>`, not module-level constants.

## Other subtler pitfalls

- **RNG is not seed-compatible.** `mx.random.normal(key=…)` and `torch.randn(generator=…)` use different algorithms. For parity tests, generate once in numpy and inject into both sides.
- **In-place semantics.** `x[idx] = y` in MLX is a rebind (copy-on-write-style), not true mutation. Don't port PyTorch code that relies on in-place performance.
- **`tensor.contiguous()`** has no exact MLX analog — arrays are logically contiguous. Ignore contiguous calls unless downstream expects a specific stride (rare).
- **`torch.einsum`** exists as `mx.einsum` but subscript semantics are identical. Prefer keeping einsum expressions as-is rather than rewriting to matmul — fewer bugs.
- **`F.scaled_dot_product_attention`** with `is_causal=True` → use `mx.fast.scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, mask="causal")`. For GQA (fewer KV heads), pass unequal-head Q and K — MLX handles it natively.
- **`torch.cumsum` on bf16** differs numerically from fp32 cumulative sums. If parity is just-above-threshold, try casting to fp32 for the cumsum step.
- **`F.silu` vs `F.hardswish`** — easy typo when reading quickly. Triple-check activation names.
- **MLX-Swift float64 → GPU crash.** Swift `Double` literals construct float64 `MLXArray`s; MLX-Swift has no float64 GPU path and crashes hard on the first GPU op. Wrap literals as `Float32(…)` before constructing arrays, cast `MLXArray.linspace` output via `.asType(.float32)`, and use `MLX.multiply` / `MLX.divide` for `Float * MLXArray` to disambiguate it from the `Duration * Duration` overload. Cast tensors handed in across public API boundaries before the first op.
- **bf16 in an autoregressive Metal diffusion / flow-matching loop garbles output.** Distinct from pitfall #7 root-cause #5 (scheduler scalar leaking fp32 *into* a bf16 latent): here the entire AR loop runs bf16 on Metal and accumulates audible glitches / garbled tokens over hundreds of steps. Pattern from OpenBMB/VoxCPM PR #263: load weights bf16 to save memory, promote AR-loop compute (LocDiT, CFM, codec head) to float32, keep AudioVAE float32. Symptom shows up in TTS LocDiT, AudioLM diffusion, and any RVQ-conditioned generator.
- **`mlx_audio.dsp.istft(…, length=L)` skips the center-pad strip.** When `length` is not `None` the function bypasses the `win_length // 2` strip that overlap-add reconstruction requires; output drifts and parity fails. Workaround: call `istft(…, length=None, normalized=True)` (the latter matches `torch.istft`'s COLA window² normalization), then zero-pad the result to your target length yourself. Found during mlx-audio PR #654 (Mel-RoFormer) parity testing.
- **`bs_roformer >= 0.4` breaks classic Mel-Band-RoFormer checkpoints.** lucidrains/bs_roformer 0.4 added nGPT-style norm parameters (`static_alpha`, `dynamic_alpha_fn`, `pre_branch_scale`, `residual_scale`, `static_beta`) and reordered the `layers` ModuleList — produces a ~500-key state-dict mismatch against Kim Vocal 2 / viperx / ZFTurbo v1.0.0 weights. Pin `bs_roformer==0.3.10` in parity test envs.

## 7. The checkerboard trap (recurring — watch for it actively)

**What goes wrong:** The per-layer parity tests pass at small scale with random weights, but end-to-end inference with real weights produces an image with a visible checkerboard pattern at a specific scale (8×8, 16×16, or matching the patch/upsample stride). The model is *almost* working — the DiT moves latents away from noise, the VAE decodes without crashing — but the output has periodic artifacts instead of a coherent image.

**Past failures:**
- **Hunyuan3D paint UNet:** 2×2 mosaic at each decoder stage — wrong axis order in `F.interpolate` equivalent.
- **ERNIE-Image v0:** 8-pixel checkerboard — off-by-one in text-encoder `hidden_states[-2]` that caused the DiT to receive text conditioning with 10× wrong magnitude *and* shifted scale.
- **Qwen-Image:** VAE `Upsample2D` used `mx.repeat` on the wrong axis (channels instead of spatial) → tile-like artifacts.

**Root causes to check, in order of frequency:**

1. **`mx.repeat` vs `mx.tile` confusion.** `mx.repeat(x, 2, axis=1)` on `(B, H, W, C)` duplicates each H-row consecutively (`[a, a, b, b, ...]`) — the correct nearest-neighbor upsample. `mx.tile(x, (1, 2, 1, 1))` produces `[a, b, ..., a, b, ...]` — block tiling, which always checkerboards. Never use `mx.tile` for upsampling.

2. **Pixel-shuffle / patch pack axis order.** Both PT `reshape(B, C, H/r, r, W/r, r) → permute(0,1,3,5,2,4)` and MLX channels-last `reshape(B, H, W, C, r, r) → transpose(0,1,4,2,5,3)` produce the same logical output. Verify by a round-trip identity test on a small known tensor (not random!) — feed `mx.arange(total)` reshaped to the input shape, unpatchify, re-patchify, and assert equal.

3. **Position IDs axis swap.** `rope_axes_dim=[text, y, x]` with grid constructed via `meshgrid(grid_y, grid_x, indexing="ij")` must stack `[yy, xx]` (not `[xx, yy]`). A swap produces subtle checkerboard because y-axis RoPE rotates channels the DiT expects to carry x-info and vice versa.

4. **Text-conditioning magnitude mismatch.** Check `hidden_states[-2]` semantics in HF transformers: it's the output of layer `N-1` — which is the INPUT to the last layer, not the OUTPUT of the last layer. So use `for layer in layers[:-1]` (apply N-1 layers), NOT `for layer in layers` then return pre-norm. Off-by-one here produces correct-looking conditioning at wrong magnitude — DiT denoises in the wrong latent manifold, checkerboard at the VAE decoder.

5. **Dtype leak from scheduler into DiT.** The `FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler.step()` in mlx-arsenal keeps `sigmas` as `fp32`; multiplying a `bf16` latent by an `fp32` scalar promotes the latent to `fp32`. The next DiT forward then runs with `fp32` input vs `bf16` weights. Cast back: `latents = scheduler.step(...).astype(dtype)`.

**Diagnostic procedure — use this EVERY port before shipping:**

```python
# Test 1: decode pure Gaussian noise through the VAE only.
# If checkerboard appears here, the VAE is broken (upsample, conv layout).
z = mx.random.normal((1, lat_H, lat_W, lat_C)) * 2.0
img = vae.decode(z)
# → should be smooth coloured noise, no periodic pattern.

# Test 2: decode noise through the *full post-DiT chain* (BN-inverse +
# pixel-shuffle + VAE). If smooth here but checkerboard end-to-end, the DiT
# output is the source.
dit_shape = (1, dit_C, lat_H // patch, lat_W // patch)
dit_out = mx.random.normal(dit_shape)
nhwc = dit_out.transpose(0, 2, 3, 1)
nhwc = vae.bn.apply_inverse(nhwc)  # if model has latent BN
unpacked = pixel_shuffle(nhwc, upscale_factor=patch)
img = vae.decode(unpacked)
# → still smooth noise. If checkerboard, the BN or pixel_shuffle axis is off.

# Test 3: real-weight DiT single-block vs reference.
# If parity < 1e-3, and tests 1/2 pass, the bug is in attention conventions
# (positions, mask format, qk_norm, RoPE axis order) which only manifest at
# the model-trained magnitudes.
```

**Preventive: add these three tests to every port's `tests/smoke/` BEFORE running full generation.** They pinpoint the layer at fault in under 30 seconds each and catch 95% of checkerboard bugs.

**Rule:** If the end-to-end output has checkerboard, do not tweak the denoising loop parameters (steps, guidance, shift) — they can never fix a wrong spatial operator. Walk up the stack with the three tests above instead.

## 8. Tekken / Pixtral tokenizer skips the BOS

**What goes wrong:** When wiring an `mlx-lm` Mistral-family text encoder (Ministral3, Mistral Small 3, Pixtral) to a diffusion DiT, you tokenize with `add_special_tokens=True` expecting `<s>` at position 0 — and it silently does NOT get added. Every content token is fine, but the FIRST token enters the attention stack at an out-of-distribution magnitude, compounds layer by layer, and the DiT receives conditioning that's correct everywhere except position 0. End-to-end generation produces a structured-but-incoherent image (barely-visible features buried in noise).

**Past failure (ERNIE-Image port, 2026-04-20):** `mistral-community/pixtral-12b` tokenizer bundled as the runtime tokenizer. Layer-by-layer diff between `mlx_lm.models.ministral3.Model` and `transformers.Ministral3Model` on identical input_ids:

| layer | token-0 max_abs | token-1..N max_abs |
|---|---|---|
| 0-1 | 0.003 | 0.005 |
| 2   | 4.18  | 0.004 |
| 3-25 | 4-7 | 0.02-0.07 |

Token-0 is 100× off from every other position and grows across the stack. Fix is prepending `tokenizer.bos_token_id` before the first content token. Once done, the content tokens 1..N keep their same (tiny) divergence and the DiT receives correct conditioning in the positions it actually uses.

**Rule:** In your pipeline's `_tokenize` / `encode_prompt` helper:

```python
ids = tokenizer(prompt, add_special_tokens=True, ...)["input_ids"]
bos = tokenizer.bos_token_id or 1
if not ids or ids[0] != bos:
    ids = [bos] + ids
```

Do this for every Tekken-family tokenizer, not just Pixtral. `add_special_tokens=True` is an identity op for these backends even though the argument name suggests otherwise.

**Idiomatic solution (publishing-time check):** Before uploading to mlx-community, inspect `tokenizer_config.json` and verify `add_bos_token: true`. mlx-lm's `TokenizerWrapper` (in `mlx_lm/tokenizer_utils.py`) respects the flag correctly when it's set. The bug only bites when the upstream repo ships a `tokenizer_config.json` without `add_bos_token`, or with it set to `false` despite the model expecting BOS. If you're routing through `mlx_lm.convert --upload-repo`, the converter copies the tokenizer config verbatim — fix upstream first, then re-convert.

## 9. Structural drift from the reference repo (the `ltx-2-mlx` lesson)

**Symptom:** the port "works" on simple paths (e.g. T2V) but subtle bugs on adjacent pipelines (keyframe, image-to-video, multi-stage) take hours to track because the MLX code no longer maps 1:1 to upstream. Every investigation hypothesis costs a round-trip: "is this divergence the bug? prove sematic equivalence first."

**Root causes** observed on `ltx-2-mlx` — all variants of the same anti-pattern (taking the shortcut during translation):

1. **Reordering operations because it's easier to write that way.** Stage 2 noised state was built `noise → cond` with a manual `LatentState` constructor instead of going through upstream's `noise_latent_state(state)` helper which orders `cond → noise`. Numerically equivalent here, but the divergence had to be proven, not assumed.
2. **Passing arguments upstream leaves at default.** Sigma `num_tokens = F×H×W` was threaded through because "you have to pass the token count somewhere", missing that upstream uses the default `4096`. The port reads as more deliberate than the original.
3. **Porting against a stale upstream version.** CFG was implemented via a direct `guided_denoise_loop` because the port pre-dated upstream's refactor to `FactoryGuidedDenoiser` + `euler_denoising_loop`. Once upstream evolves, the port diverges further with every sync, and structural drift compounds.
4. **In-place mutation instead of porting the abstraction.** LoRA was fused in-place between stages because it "worked", instead of porting upstream's pattern of constructing `stage_2 = DiffusionStage(loras=base+distilled)` at init time.
5. **Flattening abstractions into the pipeline.** Upstream's `DiffusionStage` / `ModalitySpec` / `EulerDiffusionStep.step` / `euler_denoising_loop` decomposition was collapsed into procedural code inline in the pipeline. Shorter to write, but every future upstream commit becomes a 3-way merge instead of a 1:1 sync, and the cohesion that made bugs *localizable in upstream* is lost in the port.

**The right structure** would have been isomorphic:
- `DiffusionStage` class with `__call__(denoiser, sigmas, noiser, video=ModalitySpec, audio=ModalitySpec)`
- `ModalitySpec` dataclass with `context, conditionings, noise_scale, initial_latent`
- `create_noised_state(tools, conditionings, noiser, ..., initial_latent)` orchestrating init → cond → noise in upstream's order
- `EulerDiffusionStep.step(sample, denoised, sigmas, step_idx)` as the stepper
- `euler_denoising_loop` looping over it
- `FactoryGuidedDenoiser` for CFG, not a direct `guided_denoise_loop`

**Diagnostic rule (raise this first, not last):** when chasing a subtle bug in a port, the **first** diagnostic tool is a side-by-side read of the upstream pipeline vs the MLX pipeline — not a numerical parity test. Structural divergences jump out instantly to the eye and eliminate whole classes of hypotheses before any tensor is materialized. Parity tests come second, to confirm that the (now visibly aligned) code actually matches numerically.

**Prevention rule:** during initial translation, if you catch yourself thinking "it's simpler to write it this way" or "I don't need this abstraction" or "I'll just inline it" — stop. That sentence is the drift starting. Port the abstraction verbatim. Note the cleanup idea for a post-parity pass that may never come, and that's fine.

## 10. VAE numerics — black images, cyan textures, gray output

**What goes wrong:** End-to-end output is structurally there but visually broken — black frames, cyan-tinted textures, washed-out gray, low-contrast mush. DiT-level parity is green; VAE parity at small scale (`hidden=64`, random weights) is green; full-pipeline output is wrong. The seven reading-time traps almost never produce *color tints* — they produce structural failure or checkerboards. A color symptom is its own signal.

**Past failures:**
- **Qwen-Image VAE:** Cyan tint on every output. Cause: `groupnorm_eps` defaulted to `1e-5` in the MLX port; upstream uses `1e-6`. The eps difference compounds across decoder stages and the activation distribution shifts into the chroma channels' codomain.
- **LTX-2 video VAE:** Black frames every 4 timesteps. Cause: `fused_norm=True` flag missing from `ModelArgs`, defaulted to `False`, so the post-attention residual ran without upstream's fused-norm path.
- **Hunyuan3D-2.1 texture UNet:** Gray output. Cause: `groupnorm_num_groups` computed from channels instead of read from config (upstream uses unconditional `32`).
- **Lance image VAE:** Black tiles every 8 pixels. Cause: `mx.eval(out)` missing on the decoder return path. The lazy tensor handed to `Image.fromarray(np.array(out))` materialized partial state and rendered as zeros in the affected regions.

**Idiomatic solution:**

1. **Parity-bisect from encoder forward.** Most VAE bugs surface at the *decoder* output but originate in the encoder's first norm or first conv. Run `tests/parity/test_vae_encoder.py` first, then `test_vae_bottleneck.py`, then `test_vae_decoder.py`. Whichever fails first is your culprit.
2. **`groupnorm_eps`, `fused_norm`, and `groupnorm_num_groups` are the three usual culprits.** All three must be `ModelArgs` fields with the **trained** default. Cross-check `config.json` (see pitfall #1).
3. **Wrap VAE decode in `mx.eval(out)` before any image conversion.** Lazy tensors handed to `np.array()` or PIL convert through whatever current numerical state exists — for an unmaterialized graph, that's zeros (renders black) or partial computation (renders cyan/gray noise). This is the same lazy-tensor failure mode as weight saving, but at inference time.

```python
img = vae.decode(latents)
mx.eval( img )                      # force materialization
img_np = np.array(img)              # now safe
Image.fromarray((img_np * 255).astype("uint8")).save("out.png")
```

**Rule:** When the symptom is a color-tinted or low-contrast image but layer parity passes at small scale, suspect a norm eps / fused-norm flag mismatch before suspecting attention or RoPE. Color tints almost never come from attention bugs.

## Reading strategy

When reading PyTorch source before porting, open three files side-by-side:
1. The module file (`model.py`).
2. The config (`config.json` in the checkpoint).
3. The base class from the parent framework (diffusers / transformers).

The module defaults often mislead; the config is the oracle; the parent class hides additional defaults one level deeper.
